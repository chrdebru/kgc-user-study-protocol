# KG Generation User Study
# Research Ethics Application
## Motivation
> Include the motivation for this KG Generation User Study often required for research ethics applications. The motivation of this study must indicate whether you are comparing mapping languages, knowledge generation tools, or different participant groups.

## Criteria for participant selection
> To be provided. Describe how you will recruit participants.

> To be provided. Describe how you will divide the participants into groups.

> To be provided. Disclosure of potential bias. Ensure to provide details about any factors that might influence the study or participant behavior, such as: Recruitment methods (e.g., recruiting from your research group or student population),  Study context (e.g., integrating the experiment into a teaching activity), and Participant compensation (e.g., course credit, monetary rewards, ...)


```
Example: This study aims to recruit 30 participants, who will be categorized into three groups based 
on their familiarity with semantic web technologies, as reported in the pre-questionnaire.

Group 1: Semantic Web practitioners experienced with RML
Group 2: Semantic Web practitioners inexperienced with RML
Group 3: Computer science background with no Semantic Web experience

Participants will be recruited via email, primarily from the lead researcher's research group. 
Additional participants may be recruited to ensure a balanced representation across the three groups. 
All participants must be 18 years of age or older.

We recruit primarily from the lead researcher's research group, which may limit the diversity of 
participants and their experiences, potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings 
(i.e., sampling bias). We also rely on volunteers. Participants who volunteer for the study may 
possess specific characteristics (e.g., a greater interest in the topic) that differentiate them 
from the broader population (i.e., self-selection bias).

## Hypotheses
The hypotheses related to this experiment are:

- <<Hypothesis 1>>
- <<Hypothesis 2>>
- <<...>>

```
Example: The hypotheses related to this experiment are:

- The representation used in tool XXX facilitates the creation of accurate RML mappings.
- Tool XXX provides a better means for KG generation for Group N compared to Group M.
```

# Process
Each participant will undergo the following steps in the study:

## Informed Consent
* Informed Consent: Participants will be provided with comprehensive information about the experiment, including its purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their rights as participants. They will be given ample time to review this information, which may be sent beforehand, and ask any questions before being requested to provide their informed consent to participate.

  * > To be provided. 

## Pre-questionnaire (10 minutes)
* Pre-Questionnaire: Participants will complete a pre-questionnaire to gather demographic information and assess their prior knowledge and experience with the relevant technologies. This questionnaire may also include questions about their expectations and attitudes towards the experiment. 

  * [Self-assessment form](./pre-questionnaire/self-assessment-questionnaire.md) 

## Presentation and documentation (60 minutes)
* Technology Presentation: A presentation will be delivered to familiarize participants with the relevant technologies involved in the experiment (tool(s), mapping language(s), …). This presentation will cover key concepts and terminology for understanding the subsequent tasks.

  * > To be provided. 

* Documentation Review: Participants will be given access to relevant documentation, such as user manuals or tutorials, to enhance their understanding of the technologies and tools involved in the study.

  * > To be provided. 

* Familiarization: Participants will be allowed to interact with the tool or mapping language processor to execute a sample mapping to understand how to execute the mapping. This step may involve a guided tutorial or a set of practice exercises. The sample mapping is not related to the task.

  * > To be provided. 

## Tasks
* Task Execution: Participants will be asked to perform specific tasks using the tool or technology being evaluated. The task will be clearly defined, and instructions will be provided to ensure all participants understand the requirements.

  * > To be provided. For an example, see [Tasks](./tasks/task.md) 

## Post-questionnaire (15 minutes)
* Post-Questionnaire: After completing the task, participants will be asked to complete a post-questionnaire to gather feedback on their experience using the tool. This questionnaire may include questions about usability, efficiency, satisfaction, and any challenges encountered during the task. The post-questionnaire also gauges their perception of the cognitive load of the tool, task, ….

  * [Mental workload questionnaire](./post-questionnaire/mental-workload.md) 


# Debriefing arrangements
> To be provided.

```
Example: The lead researcher will answer all participant questions about the rationale 
for the study, methods of analysis, etc., at any point throughout or after this study.
```

# Method Analysis

# Ethical considerations
> To be provided.

```
Example: All data will be collected with participant consent. If a participant wishes 
to end their participation at any point during this study, their data will be immediately 
deleted. All participant responses will be anonymized.
