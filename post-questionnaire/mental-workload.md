# Mental Workload

## The Workload Profile (Tsang and Velazquez, 1996)

On a scale from 0 to 100, rate the following demands of your tasks. A rating of 0 means that the task placed no demand, while 100 indicates that it required maximum attention.

| | Question | Rating |
| :-: | - | :-: |
| WP1 | How much attention was required for activities like remembering, problem-solving, decision-making, and perceiving (detecting, recognizing, and identifying objects)? |
| WP2 | How much attention was required to select the proper response channel (manual - keyboard/mouse, or speech - voice) and its execution? |
| WP3 | How much attention was required for spatial processing (spatially pay attention around)? |
| WP4 | How much attention was required for verbal material (e.g., reading, processing linguistic material, listening to verbal conversations)? |
| WP5 | How much attention was required to execute the task based on the information visually received (eyes)? |
| WP6 | How much attention was required to execute the task based on the information auditorily received? |
| WP7 | How much attention was required to manually respond to the task (e.g., keyboard/mouse)? |
| WP8 | How much attention was required to produce the speech response (e.g., engaging in a conversation, talking, answering questions)? |


## The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) instrument (Hart, 2006)

On a scale from 1 (low/poor) to 20 (high/good), rate the following demands of your tasks.


| | Question | Rating |
| :-: | - | :-: |
| NT1 | Mental Demand. How much mental and perceptual activity was required (e.g., thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)? Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex, exacting or forgiving? |
| NT2 | Physical Demand. How much physical activity was required (e.g., pushing, pulling, turning, controlling, activating)? Was the task easy or demanding, slow or brisk, slack or strenuous, restful or laborious? |
| NT3 | Temporal Demand. How much time pressure did you feel due to the rate or pace at which the tasks or task elements occurred? Was the pace slow and leisurely or rapid and frantic? |
| NT4 | Effort. How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish your level of performance? |
| NT5 | Performance. How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the task set by the experimenter (or yourself)? How satisfied were you with your performance in accomplishing these goals? |
| NT6 | Frustration level. How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed versus secure, gratified, content, relaxed, and complacent did you feel during the task? |

Which of the two contributed the most to the mental workload during the task?

| Demand 1 | | Demand 2 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Physical Demand | or | Frustration |
| Mental Demand | or | Effort |
| Physical Demand | or | Effort |
| Effort		 | or | Frustration |
| Effort		 | or | Performance |
| Temporal Demand | or | Performance |
| Performance	 | or | Frustration |
| Mental Demand | or | Temporal Demand |
| Temporal Demand | or | Effort |
| Physical Demand | or | Performance |
| Physical Demand | or | Temporal Demand |
| Mental Demand | or | Physical Demand |
| Temporal Demand | or | Frustration |
| Mental Demand | or | Frustration |
| Mental Demand | or | Performance |

Count the number of times you have chosen:

| Demand | Count |
| :-: | :-: |
| Mental Demand | |
| Physical Demand | |
| Temporal Demand | |
| Effort | |
| Performance | |
| Frustration | |
